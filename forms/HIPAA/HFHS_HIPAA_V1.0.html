    <h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</h1>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keeping your protected health information private is
        important to us. <span style=" color: #333;">This HIPAA authorization document has more details about how we
            will use and share </span>your protected health information, which may include information in your health
        and medical records. If you sign this document, you give permission to all clinics, hospitals, or other health
        care providers that you use, including Henry Ford Health System], directly or by an entity on its behalf, to use
        and disclose (release) your protected health information to the NCI for the Connect for Cancer Prevention Study
        (Connect). Your protected health information may also be used and disclosed by future researchers primarily to
        better understand the causes of cancer and how to prevent cancer as well as to use for general research
        purposes.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once your protected health
        information is disclosed to NCI, it is no longer protected by the Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its regulations. Instead, NCI follows federal privacy laws to protect your
        information, including the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, Certificates of Confidentiality, 42 U.S.C
        241<span style=" color: #333;">, </span>and the Common Rule, 45 CFR 46, as applicable. Below is an explanation
        of how your protected health information will be used and disclosed for Connect.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Description of the Connect for Cancer Prevention
        Study</h1>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This research study is designed to identify the
        causes of cancer and how to prevent cancer in adults. It is led by the NCI in partnership with selected health
        care organizations in the United States. Connect will recruit a large group of people and follow them for many
        years. Connect will collect information from electronic health and medical records, ask for donated samples
        (biological specimens), and Connect will ask participants to answer surveys. All of this information will be
        protected under applicable Federal laws. The information collected from study participants will help researchers
        better understand the causes of cancer and how to prevent cancer in adults.</p>
