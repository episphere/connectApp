If you sign this document, you give permission to all clinics, hospitals, or other health care providers that you use, including Kaiser Permanente Colorado, directly or by an entity on its behalf, to use and disclose (release) your protected health information to the NCI for the Connect for Cancer Prevention Study (Connect). Your protected health information may also be used and disclosed by future researchers primarily to better understand the causes of cancer and how to prevent cancer as well as to use for general research purposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once your protected health information is disclosed to NCI, it is no longer protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its regulations. Instead, NCI follows federal privacy laws to protect your information, including the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, Certificates of Confidentiality, 42 U.S.C 241<span style=" color: #333;">, </span>and the Common Rule, 45 CFR 46, as applicable.

It is led by the NCI in partnership with selected health care organizations in the United States. Connect will recruit a large group of people and follow them for many years. Connect will collect information from electronic health and medical records, ask for donated samples (biological specimens), and Connect will ask participants to answer surveys. All of this information will be protected under applicable Federal laws. The information collected from study participants will help researchers better understand the causes of cancer and how to prevent cancer in adults.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protected health information that will be used and disclosed</h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your protected health information that will be used and disclosed for this research includes:</p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text="■"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Information that identifies you, like your name, address, and important dates</p></li><li data-list-text="■"><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">Information from your health record, such as diagnoses, medications, results of physical exams, procedures, and lab tests you have before and during the study, including genetic test results, mental health diagnoses and treatment, HIV/AIDS status.
