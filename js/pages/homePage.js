                         <p>If we learn how to prevent cancer, we can lower the number of people who get it. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. While treatments are improving, the number of people who get cancer is expected to rise in the next 10 years as the population ages and lifestyles and behaviors continue to change.</p>
                         <p>To study the causes of cancer and learn how to prevent it, we can follow groups of people over a long period of time. In research, we call these groups cohorts. The Connect for Cancer Prevention Study will follow a new cohort of 200,000 adults throughout the United States.</p>

                         <p>We are looking for people who have never had cancer to join Connect, but there are some exceptions. If you have or once had non-melanoma skin cancer, or a condition that raises the risk of getting cancer, such as ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) of the breast (stage 0 breast cancer), you <u>can still join Connect</u>. If you have any of these conditions, we hope you join Connect. We are interested in learning how these conditions may relate to cancer risk.</p>
                         </div>
                         <p>Patterns that affect cancer risk may vary based on where people live, their race and ethnicity, their age, and other factors. It is important for Connect to include many types of people so that new discoveries can benefit everybody.</p>
                         <p>We are launching Connect today because modern cohorts are needed to study new and future exposures that may affect cancer risk. We are using new technology and research methods that can lead to key discoveries to prevent cancer.</p>

                         <p>We will reach out to you when you join the study and then a few times each year to ask for updates about your health and information about things like your habits, diet, exercise, and use of alcohol or tobacco.</p>
                         <p>We will also ask you to donate samples of blood, urine, and saliva (biological specimens) when you join the study and every two or three years after. These samples provide information about what is going on in your body. Information from different types of samples can help us find health and behavior patterns that may affect cancer risk.

                         <p>Connect will go on for many years because events that may affect cancer risk happen over a lifetime, and most cancers develop later in life. If you join, we hope you take part for many years. The longer you participate, the more we may learn.</p>

                         <p>For a study of this size and importance, we partnered with health care systems throughout the United States. People who get their health care through these systems tend to stay for a long time. This is an important quality for cohort studies like ours that need to follow people over the course of their lives.</p>
                         <p>Health care systems store private, protected information about their patients’ health from all aspects of care in the form of electronic health records (EHRs). By agreeing to share the information in your EHRs with Connect, researchers can get a full picture of your health. We can also coordinate with your health care system to collect leftover samples from your regular health care visits, like stool or urine, or tissue from people who develop a cancer or precancer.</p>

Study teams at partner health care systems have experience conducting research studies like Connect, and many have particular expertise in research related to cancer.</p>

Our team and other researchers at NCI have long histories of studying cancer and have made important discoveries. For example, in another cohort study, we found that drinking coffee was associated with lower risk of death from cancer and other causes. This was good news for coffee drinkers! NCI research informs public health policy in the United States and around the world. Connect will contribute evidence that can impact public health policy far into the future.</p>

                    <p>Connect surveys will ask about your health, habits, family, home, and work. We will send you surveys to complete when you join the study and then a few times each year. The first survey can take one to two hours to complete. This survey is broken into sections, so you can pause and return to complete it at any time. Most follow up surveys will take 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Surveys can be completed on any computer, tablet, or smartphone that connects to the internet. You can skip any questions that you are not comfortable answering.</p>

                    <p>We will ask you to donate blood, urine, and saliva samples (biological specimens) when you join the study and then every two to three years after. Samples are like time capsules of information about your current health status. We collect samples throughout your time in Connect to study how your health may change. Studying these changes is important to understanding how cancer and other health outcomes may develop.</p>
                    <p>When you donate each sample, we will ask you to answer a short survey about your recent actions (like medicines you took or foods you ate).</p>
                    <p>Some samples may be collected where you get your health care. Others are easy for you to collect at home. There is no monetary cost tied to donating samples.</p>
                    <p>After you complete the first set of surveys and donate your first blood sample, you will receive $25 in cash or as a gift card, depending on your health care system.</p>

Your blood, urine, and other samples help researchers understand what is happening in your body.
