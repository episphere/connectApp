Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. While treatments are improving, the number of people who get cancer is expected to rise in the next 10 years as the population ages and lifestyles and behaviors continue to change.</p><p>To study the causes of cancer and learn how to prevent it, we can follow groups of people over a long period of time. In research, we call these groups cohorts. The Connect for Cancer Prevention Study will follow a new cohort of 200,000 adults throughout the United States.</p><div class=\"blog-intro-text\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cancer.gov/connect-prevention-study/sites/g/files/xnrzdm246/files/styles/cgov_article/public/cgov_image/media_image/2021-06/biracial-family.jpg?h=10690783&amp;itok=UknIZyNT\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:10px;\" alt=\"A couple with two women are swinging a child held between them and smiling\" /><p>We are looking for people who have never had cancer to join Connect, but there are some exceptions. If you have or once had non-melanoma skin cancer, or a condition that raises the risk of getting cancer, such as ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) of the breast (stage 0 breast cancer), you <u>can still join Connect</u>. If you have any of these conditions, we hope you join Connect. We are interested in learning how these conditions may relate to cancer risk.</p></div><p>Patterns that affect cancer risk may vary based on where people live, their race and ethnicity, their age, and other factors. It is important for Connect to include many types of people so that new discoveries can benefit everybody.</p><p>We are launching Connect today because modern cohorts are needed to study new and future exposures that may affect cancer risk. We are using new technology and research methods that can lead to key discoveries to prevent cancer.</p>",
        "whatExpectSection": "<h2 id=\"what-to-expect-if-you-decide-to-join\"><br><p>What to Expect If You Decide to Join</p></h2><p>We will reach out to you when you join the study and then a few times each year to ask for updates about your health and information about things like your habits, diet, exercise, and use of alcohol or tobacco.</p><p>We will also ask you to donate samples of blood, urine, and saliva (biological specimens) when you join the study and every two or three years after. These samples provide information about what is going on in your body. Information from different types of samples can help us find health and behavior patterns that may affect cancer risk.

        "wherePlaceSection": "<h2 id=\"where-this-study-takes-place\"><p>Where This Study Takes Place</p></h2><p>For a study of this size and importance, we partnered with health care systems throughout the United States. People who get their health care through these systems tend to stay for a long time. This is an important quality for cohort studies like ours that need to follow people over the course of their lives.</p><p>Health care systems store private, protected information about their patients’ health from all aspects of care in the form of electronic health records (EHRs). By agreeing to share the information in your EHRs with Connect, researchers can get a full picture of your health. We can also coordinate with your health care system to collect leftover samples from your regular health care visits, like stool or urine, or tissue from people who develop a cancer or precancer.</p>",

Study teams at partner health care systems have experience conducting research studies like Connect, and many have particular expertise in research related to cancer.</p></div><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem\">Our team at NCI is part of the largest cancer research group in the world that studies the causes of disease, or epidemiology. Our team and other researchers at NCI have long histories of studying cancer and have made important discoveries. For example, in another cohort study, we found that drinking coffee was associated with lower risk of death from cancer and other causes. This was good news for coffee drinkers! NCI research informs public health policy in the United States and around the world. Connect will contribute evidence that can impact public health policy far into the future.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5rem\">See the full <a href=\"https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/connect#study-team\" >Connect team</a> information page to learn about the people leading this research.</p>",

        "resultsPageBody1": "From time to time, you will receive information grouped from all the people taking part in Connect. For example, you may receive information about the percentage of current Connect participants who report sleep difficulties, or who drink coffee.",
        "resultsPageBody2": "We will also offer to share with you some of the things that we learn specifically about you. The information we share may include results from your surveys or from tests of your samples. These tests may be run at different time points. Because of the types of research questions we will be asking through Connect, and since we are always going to be looking for new ideas to explore, it may be years before we run some tests and get information to share back with you. Other tests may be run sooner. We carefully save samples at the Connect lab for future studies to be sure we will be able to make the most out of every sample you donate as part of Connect.",
        "resultsPageBody3": "When we have information or results about you to share, we will let you know. At that time, we will share background information on the results and how they could be used. You may then decide if you want to receive them. If you choose to receive results, we will share them securely on MyConnect.",

        "leavingPageBody2": "You will receive $25 in cash or as a gift card after you complete all sections of the first online survey and donate your first blood sample.",
        "indigenousPageHeader": "Why is Connect interested in engaging Indigenous Peoples?",
        "indigenousPageBody1": "Our goal as a Connect team is to be inclusive. We want to include people from many places and backgrounds throughout the United States so our findings may benefit all communities.Connect aims to include people and communities that have been left out of research in the past, such as Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous populations native to the U.S. may include people who identify as American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and/or Pacific Islander and their communities. If people from many backgrounds, such as Indigenous Peoples, are left out of research, we cannot learn if research findings apply to them, their communities, or their future generations.",
        "indigenousPageBody2": "Would you like to learn more about what it means to take part in Connect for anyone who identifies as an Indigenous Person?",
        "indigenousPageYes": " Yes, tell me more",
        "indigenousPageNo": " No, continue to consent",
        "indigenousAffectPageHeader": "How might my participation in Connect affect Indigenous communities?",
        "indigenousAffectPageBody1": "Some Indigenous Peoples and their communities have emphasized the need to learn more about certain risks and benefits to participating in research studies. Community members may be concerned that research practices will not follow traditional customs, or that conclusions made about Indigenous participants might harm Indigenous communities. However, learning about the health of Indigenous participants may help us make medical discoveries that benefit other people from these communities. Including all communities in research is an important part of advancing medicine and extending benefits to all people.",
        "indigenousAffectPageBody2": "We acknowledge past transgressions and abuses of Indigenous Peoples in research studies, and the harms these have caused Indigenous communities. We oppose any research that harms Indigenous Peoples and we do not support any research or researcher that has harmed any community. We respect and appreciate your willingness to work with us and know your trust must be earned. We are committed to protecting your privacy, keeping your information safe, and maintaining the integrity of our research. We want our research to respect the cultures and practices of all Indigenous Peoples.",
        "indigenousAffectPageBody3": "We may not understand the barriers that Indigenous Peoples face when it comes to participating in research studies. However, we hope to work with you to learn more about the considerations and concerns of your communities and advance our understanding of health and disease together. As a Connect team, we hope to make medical discoveries that will benefit all people.",
        "indigenousProtectPageHeader": "How is my information protected?",
        "indigenousProtectPageBody1": "If you join the study, we will remove your personal information, like your name, date of birth, and health information, from your survey answers and samples before we share them with researchers. Only researchers who agree to our privacy rules may use your survey answers and samples for their research. These researchers will not have access to information that identifies you.",
        "indigenousProtectPageBody2": "As part of our research, we look for patterns to learn more about health and disease. Your self-identified race will be linked to your information and samples and can help us study these patterns.",
        "indigenousProtectPageBody3": "It is possible that when members of small populations (such as some Indigenous populations) take part in research, it may be easier to identify them from other information they share. This also means it may be easier to connect someone back to their community. Connect prohibits researchers from attempting to re-identify individual participants or link them to their communities.",
        "indigenousProtectPageBody4": "It is possible that research findings could be associated with people who share your race identity. Connect opposes publishing research findings that stigmatize Indigenous communities or any racial or ethnic group.",

Social Security Numbers help us link to public health databases and ensure that the information we collect from these sources is correctly matched to you.</p><p>Your privacy is important to us and there are protections in place to keep your Social Security Number safe. We store your Social Security Number in a secure database separate from other information you share, including survey answers, samples, and personal information such as your name. Only a small number of Connect staff will have access to Social Security Number information. These staff will not be researchers using the data for future studies, but will be responsible for protecting this information and only using it to match data from other public health sources to your Connect participant record.
